# Linear-Algebra-Final-Project
This is a repository containing the code of a project on audio classification for my linear algebra for data science class. Again, I wish I could add the audio files for you to run it and test it but I can't find a convenient way to do it. Anyways, I have added a link to the dataset and other resources used in the report/research document I wrote about the project.
